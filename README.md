A silly website I made to taunt my good friend Keith about an inside joke related to a game of Monopoly we played back in the day.

The website can be accessed at www.DoesKeithLikeNuts.com.

Although it is a bit overkill, I use Google App Engine with a simple python backend to spit out the html/css.  So basically this serves as my form of free hosting :)
